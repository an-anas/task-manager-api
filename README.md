## TaskManager API

### Overview

TaskManager API is a RESTful service built with **ASP.NET Core 8** that manages tasks through standard CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

It uses **MongoDB** for data storage and retrieval, and **Docker** for containerization, which simplifies deployment and ensures consistency across different environments.
